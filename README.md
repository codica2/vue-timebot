# Admin interface for timebot

The administration panel is the inner side of our time tracking tool. It is particularly valuable for project managers as it fully reflects the overall performance statistics on individuals, teams, and projects at any chosen time period.

The admin panel UI is very simple and attractive. We adopted ready-to-use vue.js libraries including customized elements.

## Dashboard
